# openCX-*BitX* Development Report

Welcome to the documentation pages of the **BitX** of **openCX**!

You can find here detailed information about the (sub)product, hereby mentioned as module, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report (see [template](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx/blob/master/docs/templates/Development-Report.md)), organized by discipline (as of RUP): 

* Business modeling 
  * [Product Vision](#Product-Vision)
  * [Elevator Pitch](#Elevator-Pitch)

## Product Vision
Creating a product that improves the user experience in the check-in process.

## Elevator Pitch
Tired of wainting in infinite queues just to make a simple check-in?
Tired of having that check-in made by ordinary people?
Here in Bitx, We have the perfect solution for you: BotX! All you have to do is have your bluetooth on and as soon as you reach the place of the event, the check-in will be made automatically for you. You will then receive a QR-code with wich you can collect your welcome kit. 
But that isn't enough, is it? 
Well, if you are one of the lucky ones, you will be rewarded with a special surprise: BotX, our genial robot will be the one delivering the welcome kit to you.
Are you ready for the best check-in of your life?!

## Requirements

Our product will result in two subproducts that interact with each other: the automatic check-in (provided by the app and beacon working together) and, for some of the users, a robot that will deliver the welcome kit.

For this, we need to build a app that fulfills some requirements
* Has the login and the logout functionalitys
* Informs the user to turn on the bluetooth
* Has a help page to inform the user on how the product works
* Informs the user when the check-in was completed
* Gives the user a QR-code so he can collect the welcome kit, if he was not selected
* Gives the user the information that he was selected to receive the kit by the robot

The server must be able to fulfill some other requirements:
* Comunicate with the robot, in order to send it to the selected user
* Generate and save the QR-codes generated
* Save information on wich QR-codes have already been read (so the same user isn't able to collect more than one welcome kit)

The robot must fulfill the following requirements:
* Meet the user (using the beacon to find out its location)
* Able to read the QR-code of the user
* Only give the kit to the user if the QR-code is valid


### Use case diagram 

*Diagram in Trello*

* The user can do the login, as long as he is logged out. To do the login, the user only needs to insert the code he received when he bought the ticket. If the user inserts a valid code, he will be redirected to another page, depending on the state of his check-in. If the user inserts an invalid code, he shall remain in the same page, receiving a message that the code was invalid. 

* The user can do the automatic check-in, as long as he is logged in, his bluetooth is on and he is on the perimeter of the beacon. If all the preconditions are satisfied, the check-in will be done sucessfully, and the server will generate a random number in order to decide whether the user is selected or not for the robot experience. The user will then be redirected to a page containing the QR-code and a message telling him if he was selected or not. If the user isn't logged in, than he will be in the page for the login. If the user's bluetooth is off, he will be in a page telling him to turn the bluetooth on. If the user isn't in the perimeter of the beacon, he will be in a page telling him the check-in still hasn't been completed. These three alternative flows, happen in the presented order.

* The user must be shown a QR-code, once he has completed the check-in. If the check-in isn't completed, another page will be shown, as explained in the precious use case.

* The user can do the logout, as long as he is logged in. Once he does it, he will be redirected to the login page.

* The user can ask to recover the code of the register. For that he must click on the option "Recover Password" on the log in page, wich will redirect him to the recover password page. To recover the password, the user must enter his email. If the email is registered in the server, a message will be shown telling him that an email was sent with the code and he will be redirected to the login page. If the email is not registered, a messege will be shown telling him so.

* The user can receive the kit by the robot, as long as he shows the robot his QR-code and it's the first time he as done so.

In any of this use cases, if there is a problem communicating with the server (example: checking for the valid code in the login, generating the QR-code, registering the check-in, etc.), the user should be redirected to a page informing him there has been an error and asking him to go the help center.

### User stories
This section will contain the requirements of the product described as **user stories**, organized in a global **user story map** with **user roles** or **themes**.

For each theme, or role, you may add a small description here. User stories should be detailed in the tool you decided to use for project management (e.g. trello or github projects).

A user story is a description of desired functionality told from the perspective of the user or customer. A starting template for the description of a user story is 

*As a < user role >, I want < goal > so that < reason >.*

You add more details after, but the shorter and complete, the better. In order to decide if the user story is good, please follow the INVEST guidelines.

After the user story text, you should add a draft of the corresponding user interfaces, a simple mockups or drafts, if applicable.

For each user story you should write also the acceptance tests (textually in Gherkin), ie, a description of situations that will help to confirm that the system satisfies the requirements addressed in the user story.

At the end, it is good to add a rough indication of the value of the user story to the customers (e.g. MoSCoW method) and the team should add an estimative of the effort to implemente it, in t-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL).

### Domain model

A simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module.
